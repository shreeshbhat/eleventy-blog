Hi, I'm Shreesh Bhat, a Senior Software Engineer at Manhattan Associates, where I love building websites.
My pronouns are they/their.

I care about performance, inclusive design, and compassionate coding.

In my spare time, you will often find me playing video games, cooking, listening to Opeth, table top gaming with my partner, or working on [Strike off](https://github.com/shreeshbhat/strike-off).

You can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/shreeshbhat) or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/shreeshbhat).
